# Liver-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Kaggle dataset containing the data of 196 Indian liver patients was taken, consisting of the attributes related to liver as in the liver function 
tests. 10 features were chosen and the Decision Tree algorithm and Random Forest algorithm were applied to them. The corresponding labels consisted of 
whether the patients had a liver disease or not. The data was also visualised by reducing the 10 dimensional graph to 2 dimensions using the tSNE algorithm 
and the accuracy of the predictions was calculated.
